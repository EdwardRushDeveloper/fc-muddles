# Dynamic Programming in Computer Science

[Geeks For Geeks - Dynamic Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/competitive-programming/dynamic-programming/)

Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for efficiently solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is widely used in computer science for optimization problems where the solution can be constructed from solutions to overlapping subproblems.

## Key Concepts

- **Optimal Substructure:** The optimal solution to a problem can be composed of optimal solutions to its subproblems.
- **Overlapping Subproblems:** The same subproblems are solved multiple times during computation.

## How It Works

Dynamic programming solves each subproblem only once and stores the result, typically using a table (array or matrix), to avoid redundant computations. This approach significantly improves performance compared to naive recursive solutions.

## Applications

- Shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's, Floyd-Warshall)
- Sequence alignment in bioinformatics
- Knapsack problem
- Fibonacci number calculation
- Edit distance (Levenshtein distance)

## Approaches

- **Top-Down (Memoization):** Recursively solve subproblems and cache their results.
- **Bottom-Up (Tabulation):** Iteratively solve subproblems and build up solutions.

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique for tackling problems with overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure, making it a cornerstone of algorithm design in computer science.
