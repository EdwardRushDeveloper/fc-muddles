# LinkedList

A **LinkedList** is a linear data structure where elements, called nodes, are stored in a sequence. Each node contains two parts: the data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, allowing for efficient insertions and deletions.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Size:** Grows or shrinks as needed.
- **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Especially at the beginning or middle of the list.
- **No Random Access:** Accessing elements requires traversal from the head node.

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List:** Each node points to the next node.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List:** The last node points back to the first node.

## Use Cases

- Implementing stacks and queues
- Undo functionality in applications
- Managing memory (e.g., free lists in memory allocators)
- Navigating through browser history or playlists

LinkedLists are chosen when frequent insertions and deletions are required, and random access is not a priority.
